## Key Improvements

}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Utilities** (`scraper/utils.py`)

#### Added Functions:
- **`parse_count(count_str)`**: Converts Facebook count strings like "1.2K", "5M" to integers
- **Enhanced text cleaning**: Better Unicode support and metadata filtering

### 4. **Main Application Updates** (`main.py`)

#### Changes:
- **Import Updated**: Now uses `PostsScraperImproved` instead of `PostsScraper`
- **Added Locations**: Now extracts `locations_visited` data
- **Updated Statistics**: Reports match new data structure

## Technical Improvements

### Better Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks when sections are not accessible
- Partial data extraction (continues even if some parts fail)
- Better timeout management

### Performance Optimizations
- Limited extraction counts to prevent infinite scrolling
- Smarter scrolling with stability detection
- Reduced delay times for faster extraction

### Data Quality
- Enhanced content vs. metadata detection
- Better text cleaning and normalization
- Improved duplicate detection

## Usage

The scraper now automatically uses the improved version:

```bash
# Run the main scraper
python3 main.py

# Or via API
curl http://your-server:8080/api/scrape/username -o profile.json
```

## Expected Output

The scraper will now produce JSON files matching your exact target structure with:
- ✅ Enhanced post details with user profiles
- ✅ Tagged accounts with bios
- ✅ Comments with full commenter information  
- ✅ Location data from posts and check-ins
- ✅ Friends, pages, groups with URLs and descriptions
- ✅ Structured about section with contact info
- ✅ Comments by user on other posts
- ✅ Comprehensive user profile data

## Testing

Run the structure test to verify everything is working:

```bash
python3 test_structure.py
```

This will validate that all components are properly imported and structured according to your target JSON format.
